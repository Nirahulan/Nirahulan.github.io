Phylicia A (3/16/2023, 1:36:12 PM): You're very welcome! It is strongly recommended that applications are submitted no less than two weeks prior to these dates as to avoid being rolled over to the next session, since this progam is very popular. 
Phylicia A (3/16/2023, 1:37:58 PM): Is there anything else I can assist you with? 
Phylicia A (3/16/2023, 1:50:56 PM): Thank you for chatting with ASU Online!
